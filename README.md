## AI Code Review System

This project features a comprehensive multi-tier AI code review system powered by OpenAI's GPT models. The system provides different levels of review based on when and what you need to check.

### 🎯 Review Types

#### 🚨 **Critical Reviews** (Automated)

**Pre-commit Review** - Fast critical issue detection
- ⚡ **Speed**: ~30 seconds using `gpt-4o-mini`
- 🎯 **Focus**: Build-breaking issues only
- 📝 **Checks**: Syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, style violations, type errors
- � **Blocking**: Only blocks for critical issues that would break the build

**Pre-push Review** - Comprehensive quality analysis  
- 🔍 **Speed**: ~60 seconds using `gpt-4o`
- 📊 **Focus**: Full code quality assessment with scoring (0-10)
- 🏗️ **Categories**: Code Quality, Performance, Security, Testing, Documentation, React/Frontend
- 🛡️ **Blocking**: Blocks for security < 6, quality < 5, or overall < 6

#### 🔧 **Specialized Reviews** (Manual)

**Security Review** (`npm run ai-security`)
- 🛡️ Authentication, authorization, input validation, dependency vulnerabilities
- � **Focus**: OWASP Top 10, security best practices, data protection

**Performance Review** (`npm run ai-performance`)  
- ⚡ Algorithm efficiency, memory usage, bundle optimization, React rendering
- � **Focus**: Performance bottlenecks, optimization opportunities

**Accessibility Review** (`npm run ai-accessibility`)
- ♿ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen readers, keyboard navigation
- 🎯 **Focus**: Inclusive design, accessibility standards

**Testing Review** (`npm run ai-testing`)
- 🧪 Test coverage, quality, edge cases, mocking strategies
- 📋 **Focus**: Test completeness and maintainability

**Documentation Review** (`npm run ai-docs`)
- 📚 Code comments, API docs, README updates, examples
- 📝 **Focus**: Code clarity and maintainability

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies & setup**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure OpenAI API**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   copy .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

3. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   # Test individual review types
   npm run ai-security      # Security-focused review
   npm run ai-performance   # Performance analysis
   npm run ai-accessibility # Accessibility review
   npm run ai-testing       # Testing quality review
   npm run ai-docs         # Documentation review
   ```

4. **Normal development workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"  # Triggers pre-commit critical review
   git push                      # Triggers pre-push comprehensive review
   ```

### 📊 Review Scoring System

The comprehensive review system scores each category out of 10:

| Category | Weight | Blocking Threshold |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 🛡️ Security | High | < 6 blocks push |
| 🏗️ Code Quality | High | < 5 blocks push |
| ⚡ Performance | Medium | Recommendations only |
| 🧪 Testing | Medium | Recommendations only |
| 📚 Documentation | Low | Recommendations only |
| ⚛️ React/Frontend | Medium | Recommendations only |

**Overall Score < 6** = Push blocked  
**Overall Score 6-7** = Push allowed with warnings  
**Overall Score 8+** = Excellent, push approved
