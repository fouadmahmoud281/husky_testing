# Simple React App with AI Code Review

A very simple and beautiful React application with modern styling and AI-powered code review using Husky hooks.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Fast and lightweight
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful glassmorphism design
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive
- âš¡ Built with React 18
- ðŸ¤– AI-powered code review with OpenAI
- ðŸ”§ Pre-commit and pre-push hooks with Husky

## AI Code Review Setup

This project includes an intelligent code review system that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze your code changes before pushing.

### Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. Optional: Customize AI settings in `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
   MAX_TOKENS=1000
   ```

### How It Works

- **Pre-commit**: Runs tests to ensure code quality
- **Pre-push**: Triggers AI code review that analyzes your git diff and provides:
  - Code quality assessment
  - Security and bug detection
  - Performance recommendations
  - Best practices suggestions
  - React/JavaScript specific improvements

### AI Review Levels

- **GOOD**: Code looks great, push allowed
- **NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT**: Suggestions provided, push allowed
- **CRITICAL_ISSUES**: Serious issues detected, push blocked

Review logs are saved in `.husky/logs/` for future reference.

## Getting Started
